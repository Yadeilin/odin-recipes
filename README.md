Recipes Project

This is the first project in which my capabilities have had to be demonstrated.
In this project a main page with three recipes within were created by adding relative
 links and local storaged images.
The main page, index.html, contains the heading of the page, and an unordered list with the
three recipes available on the page.
Each recipe has it's own page, in which is displayed an image of the recipe, a description
using an h3 heading, an unordered list of the ingridients, followed by an ordered 
list of the directions.

Performing this assigments helped me to set in stone the basic steps to build a page on my 
head, which will automatie these steps in future assigments.
